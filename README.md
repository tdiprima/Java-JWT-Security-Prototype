<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">I have a Spring Boot application with Wicket and Keycloak. We want to use pac4j, shiro, and io.jsonwebtoken to create and validate a JWT token, and whatever other security configurations we need.

To implement JWT authentication using pac4j, Shiro, and io.jsonwebtoken in your Spring Boot and Wicket application, here's a complete real-world example:

### 1. **pom.xml Dependencies**

First, ensure that you include the required dependencies in your `pom.xml` file.

### 2. **JWT Utility Class**

This class handles creating and validating JWT tokens using `io.jsonwebtoken`.

### 3. **Security Configuration**

Configure pac4j, Shiro, and the JWT filter in your Spring Boot application. This configuration will handle the authentication process.

### 4. **Shiro Filter in Spring Boot**

Here, we define the filter that will intercept requests and validate the JWT token.

### 5. **Integrating Wicket**

In your Wicket application, you would add a `SpringComponentInjector` to inject Spring beans (like the security configuration) and set up authentication checks.

<span style="color:#59acf3;font-size:larger;">MyWicketApplication

### Explanation of the Flow:

1. **JWT Creation and Validation**: The `JwtTokenUtil` class creates and validates JWT tokens using `io.jsonwebtoken`. This includes extracting claims like the username and expiration date from the token.

2. **Security Configuration**: In the `SecurityConfig` class, we configure Shiro to use `pac4j` for JWT authentication. The secret key is shared between the JWT utility and the authentication configuration. The `JwtAuthenticator` validates the token during request interception.

3. **Shiro Filter**: The `JwtFilter` intercepts HTTP requests and checks the `Authorization` header for a JWT. If found, it validates the token using the `JwtTokenUtil` class.

4. **Wicket Integration**: The Spring-configured security is injected into Wicket components, allowing your Wicket application to perform JWT-based security checks.

This setup should give you a solid foundation to integrate JWT-based security using pac4j, Shiro, and Keycloak in a Spring Boot + Wicket application.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">In MyWicketApplication, it says "You can use securityConfig.pac4jConfig() here to manage JWT authentication".  Can you write the code for me?

Here's how you can modify `MyWicketApplication` to integrate JWT authentication using the `pac4jConfig()` from your `SecurityConfig`:

1. **Configure the Pac4j Security in Wicket Application**:

   In your Wicket application, you'll set up a security filter using pac4j to handle JWT authentication for specific pages or components.

2. **Set Up Pac4j Filter in `MyWicketApplication`**:

   Here's the complete code that shows how to configure pac4j security for Wicket using `SecurityConfig`:

<span style="color:#59acf3;font-size:larger;">MyWicketApplication

### Key Elements of the Code:

1. **`setupPac4jSecurity()`**: This method retrieves the Pac4j security configuration (`Config pac4jConfig`) from the `SecurityConfig` class and sets up a security logic (`DefaultSecurityLogic`). This logic checks the JWT token and authenticates the user.

2. **Request Cycle Listener**: The listener (`AbstractRequestFilter`) intercepts the request and uses Pac4j's `SecurityLogic` to validate the JWT token. If the token is valid, the user is authenticated; if not, they are redirected to an unauthorized page.

3. **Unauthorized Handler**: If JWT authentication fails (invalid token or missing token), the application redirects the user to an `UnauthorizedPage` (a custom page you would define in your application).

4. **`WicketWebContext`**: This converts the Wicket request cycle into Pac4j's `WebContext`, allowing Pac4j to work seamlessly with Wicket's request model.

5. **Home Page**: The `getHomePage()` method specifies the main page of your Wicket application.

### Next Steps:

- **Define `UnauthorizedPage`**: You can create a simple Wicket page class that informs the user that they are not authorized.

<span style="color:#59acf3;font-size:larger;">UnauthorizedPage


With this setup, your Wicket application will now validate JWT tokens on every request cycle, ensuring proper authentication before allowing access to protected pages.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Do I have to set up shiro.ini?

No, you don't strictly need to set up a `shiro.ini` file if you are using pac4j for JWT authentication and managing most of the security logic through Spring Boot and pac4j's configuration. However, if you plan to use Apache Shiro for additional security management, such as role-based access control (RBAC), session management, or other advanced features that Shiro offers, then you might want to configure a `shiro.ini` file.

If you're focusing only on JWT authentication with pac4j, you can skip `shiro.ini` and use Spring configuration instead. Here's how the two compare:

### 1. **If Using Only Pac4j and Spring Security (No Shiro)**

You can handle JWT token authentication and authorization purely through the Spring and pac4j configuration, as shown in the previous code samples. There's no need for a `shiro.ini` file in this case because the `SecurityConfig` class and pac4j's `JwtAuthenticator` manage all authentication.

### 2. **If You Want to Use Shiro for Role-Based Access Control or Session Management**

If you want to leverage Shiro for managing user roles, permissions, or other features, you might want to configure `shiro.ini`. Here's an example of a minimal `shiro.ini`:

```ini
[main]
# JWT realm that handles JWT tokens
jwtRealm = org.pac4j.shiro.realm.Pac4jRealm
securityManager.realms = $jwtRealm

# Session management (optional)
sessionManager = org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager
securityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager

# Cache management (optional)
cacheManager = org.apache.shiro.cache.MemoryConstrainedCacheManager
securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager

[users]
# Define users (username=password,role)
admin=admin,admin
user=user,user

[roles]
# Define role permissions
admin=*
user=read
```

### When to Use shiro.ini:
- **Role-based access**: Shiro can define user roles and permissions in an `.ini` file or programmatically.
- **Session management**: Shiro can manage sessions, which can be beneficial if your application requires more control over user sessions.
- **Cache management**: Shiro has built-in support for caching authorization data, which can be useful for improving performance.

In summary, **if you only need JWT-based security with pac4j**, you don't need `shiro.ini`. If you want to take advantage of Shiro's additional features, then configuring a `shiro.ini` or setting up roles and permissions programmatically is a good idea.

## web.xml?

In modern Spring Boot applications, you typically **don't need to use `web.xml`** because Spring Boot relies on annotations and Java-based configuration to set up filters, servlets, and security. However, if you're working with an older setup or prefer XML-based configuration, you can add filters there.

### Option 1: **Spring Boot Java-based Configuration (Preferred)**

For most Spring Boot projects, filters are defined programmatically in Java. You can add your filter using a `@Bean` or by extending `OncePerRequestFilter` in a `@Configuration` class, like in the `SecurityConfig` I showed earlier. There's no need for `web.xml`.

### Option 2: **Adding the Filter in web.xml (If Required)**

If you are using `web.xml` and you want to manually add the filter for Pac4j, Shiro, or any custom JWT filter, you can do so like this:

```xml
<filter>
    <filter-name>shiroFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.IniShiroFilter</filter-class>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>shiroFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern> <!-- Apply to all URLs -->
</filter-mapping>
```

You would replace `IniShiroFilter` with the appropriate filter class depending on what filter you are using (for example, if you have a custom JWT filter or pac4j filter).

### Example for a Custom JWT Filter in web.xml:

```xml
<filter>
    <filter-name>jwtFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.example.filters.JwtFilter</filter-class> <!-- Your custom filter class -->
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>jwtFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern> <!-- Apply to all URLs -->
</filter-mapping>
```

### Do You Need to Add the Filter in web.xml?

If you're using **Spring Boot** and its configuration, you can skip `web.xml` entirely. If you're using **Wicket with Shiro** or some other servlet-based approach, you might want to use `web.xml`, but it's generally not necessary in a Spring Boot project unless you're maintaining a legacy setup.
